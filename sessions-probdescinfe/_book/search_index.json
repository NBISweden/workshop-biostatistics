Whenever chance is involved in the outcome of an experiment the outcome is a random variable. A random variable can not be predicted exactly, but the probability of all possible outcomes can be described. A random variable is usually denoted by a capital letter, \\(X, Y, Z, \\dots\\). Values collected in an experiment are observations of the random variable, usually denoted by lowercase letters \\(x, y, z, \\dots\\). The population is the collection of all possible observations of the random variable. Note, the population is not always countable. A sample is a subset of the population. Example random variables and probabilites: The weight of a random newborn baby, \\(W\\). \\(P(W&gt;4.0kg)\\) The smoking status of a random mother, \\(S\\). \\(P(S=1)\\) The hemoglobin concentration in blood, \\(Hb\\). \\(P(Hb&lt;125 g/L)\\) The number of mutations in a gene BMI of a random man Weight status of a random man (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) The result of throwing a die Conditional probability can be written for example \\(P(W \\geq 3.5 | S = 1)\\), which is the probability that \\(X \\geq 3.5\\) if \\(S = 1\\), in words “the probability that a smoking mother has a baby with birth weight of 3.5 kg or more”. 1.1.2 The urn model The urn model is a simple model commonly used in statistics and probability. In the urn model real objects (such as people, mice, cells, genes, molecules, etc) are represented by balls of different colors. A fair coin can be represented by an urn with two balls representing the coins two sides. A group of people can be modelled in an urn model, if age is the variable of interest, we write the age of each person on the balls. If we instead are interested in if the people are allergic to pollen or not, we color the balls according to allergy status. Figure 1.1: Urn models of a fair coin, age of a group of people, pollen alllergy status of a group of people. By drawing balls from the urn with (or without) replacement probabilities and other properties of the model can be inferred. 1.2 Discrete random variables A discrete random number has countable number of outcomes values, such as {1,2,3,4,5,6}; {red, blue, green}; {tiny, small, average, large, huge} or all integers. A discrete random variable can be described by its probability mass function, pmf. The probability that the random variable, \\(X\\), takes the value \\(x\\) is denoted \\(P(X=x) = p(x)\\). Note that: \\(0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1\\), a probability is always between 0 and 1. \\(\\sum p(x) = 1\\), the sum over all possible outcomes is 1. Example 1.1 (The number of dots on a die) When rolling a die the there are six possible outcomes; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, each of which have the same probability, if the die is fair. The outcome of one dice roll can be described by a random variable \\(X\\). The probability of a particular outcome \\(x\\) is denoted \\(P(X=x)\\) or \\(p(x)\\). The probability mass function of a fair six-sided die can be summarized in a table; x 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 p(x) 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.17 or in a barplot; Figure 1.2: Probability mass function of a die. non-smoker smoker x 0 1 p(x) 0.61 0.39 Example 1.2 (CFU) The number of bacterial colonies on a plate is a random number. Figure 1.3: Probability mass distribution of the number of bacterial colonies on an agar plate. 1.2.0.1 Expected value When the probability mass function is know the expected value of the random variable can be computed. \\[E[X] = \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i p(x_i)\\] For a uniform distribution, where every object has the same probability (in the urn model, every object is represented by one ball), the expected value can be computed as the sum of all objects divided by the total number of objects; \\[E[X] = \\mu = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\] 1.2.0.2 Variance The variance is a measure of spread and is defined as the expected value of the squared distance from the population mean; \\[var(X) = \\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\mu)^2 p(x) dx\\] 1.2.1 Simulate distributions Once the distribution is known, we can compute probabilities, such as \\(P(X=x), P(X&lt;x)\\) and \\(P(X \\geq x)\\). If the distribution is not known, simulation might be the solution. Example 1.3 (Simulate coin toss) In a single coin toss the probabity of heads is 0.5. In 20 coin tosses, what is the probability of at least 15 heads? The outcome of a single coin toss is a random variable, \\(X\\) with two possible outcomes \\(\\{H, T\\}\\). We know that \\(P(X=H) = 0.5\\). The radnom variable of interest is the number of heads in 20 coin tosses, \\(Y\\). The probability that we need to compute is \\(P(Y \\geq 15)\\). Figure 1.4: A coin toss. Urn model with one black ball (heads) and one white ball (tails). A single coin toss can be modelled by an urn with two balls. When a ball is drawn randomly from the urn, the probability to get the black ball (heads) is \\(P(X=H) = 0.5\\). If we want to simulate tossing 20 coins (or one coin 20 times) we can use the same urn model, if the ball is replaced after each draw. In R we can simulate random draws from an urn model using the function sample. # A single coin toss sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=1) ## [1] &quot;T&quot; # Another coin toss sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=1) ## [1] &quot;H&quot; Every time you run the sample a new coin toss is simulated. The argument size tells the function how many balls we want to draw from the urn. To draw 20 balls from the urn, set size=20, remember to replace the ball after each draw! # 20 independent coin tosses (coins &lt;- sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=20, replace=TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; ## [20] &quot;H&quot; How many heads did we get in the 20 random draws? # How many heads? sum(coins == &quot;H&quot;) ## [1] 8 We can repeat this experiment (toss 20 coins and count the number of heads) several times to estimate the distribution of number of heads in 20 coin tosses. To do the same thing several times we use the function replicate. To simulate tossing 20 coins and counting the number of heads 10000 times, do the following; Nheads &lt;- replicate(10000, { coins &lt;- sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=20, replace=TRUE) sum(coins == &quot;H&quot;) }) Plot distribution of the number of heads in a histogram. hist(Nheads, breaks=0:20) Now, let’s get back to the question; when tossing 20 coins, what is the probability of at least 15 heads? \\(P(X \\geq 15)\\) Count how many times out of our 10000 exeriments the number is 15 or greater sum(Nheads &gt;= 15) ## [1] 190 From this we conclude that \\(P(X \\geq 15) =\\) 190/10000 = 0.02 1.2.2 Parametric discrete distributions 1.2.2.1 Bernoulli trial A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment with two outcomes; success and failure. The probability of success, \\(P(success) = p\\), is constant. The probability of failure is \\(P(failure) = 1-p\\). When coding it is convenient to code success as 1 and failure as 0. The outcome of a Bernoulli trial is a discrete random variable, \\(X\\). x 0 1 p(x) 1-p p Using the definitions of expected value and variance it can be shown that; \\[E[X] = p\\\\ var(X) = p(1-p)\\] 1.2.2.2 Binomial distribution The number of successes in a series of independent and identical Bernoulli trials is a discrete random variable, \\(X\\). The probability mass function of \\(X\\) is called the binomial distribution. In short we use the notation; \\[X \\in Bin(n, p)\\] Using the definition of expected value and variance it can be shown that; The probability mass function is \\[P(X=k) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\] \\[E[X] = np\\\\ var(X) = np(1-p)\\] The binomial distribution occurs when sampling \\(n\\) objects with replacement from an urn with objects of two types, of which the interesting type has probability \\(p\\). The probability mass function, \\(P(X=k)\\) can be computed using the R function dbinom and the cumulative distribution function \\(P(X \\leq k)\\) can be computed using pbinom. 1.2.2.3 Hypergeometric distribution The hypergeometric distribution occurs when sampling \\(n\\) objects without replacement from an urn with \\(N\\) objects of two types, of which the interesting type has probability \\(p\\). The probability density function \\[P(X=k) = \\frac{{Np \\choose x} {N-Np \\choose n-x}}{N \\choose n}\\] can be computed in R using dhyper and the cumulative distribution function \\(P(X \\ leq k)\\) can be computed using phyper. 1.2.2.4 Poisson distribution The Poisson distribution describe the number of times a rare event occurs in a large number of trials. A rare disease has a very low probability for a single individual. The number of individuals in a large population that catch the disease in a certain time perion can be modelled using the Poisson distribution. The probability mass function; \\[P(X=k) = \\frac{\\mu}{k!}e^{-\\mu},\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the expected value. 1.3 Exercises 1.3.1 Introduction to probability Exercise 1.1 When tossing a fair coin a) what is the probability of heads? b) what is the probability of tails?

You are interested in a particular pathway A. 200 genes in pathway A are represented among the 20000 genes, 20 of these are in the bioinformaticians important list. If the bioinformatician selected the 1000 genes at random, what is the probability to see 20 or more genes from pathway A in this list? 1.3.4 Conditional probability Exercise 1.12 Diagnostic tests pos neg tot not cancer 98 882 980 cancer 16 4 20 total 114 886 1000 What is the probability of a positive test result from a person with cancer?

If the test is negative, what is the probability of not having cancer? Connect the four computed probabilities with the following four tems; Sensitivity Specificity Positive predictive value (PPV) Negative predictive value (NPV) 1.4 Continuous random variable A continuous random number is not limited to discrete values, but any continuous number within one or several ranges is possible. Examples: weight, height, speed, intensity, … A continuous random variable can be described by its probability density function, pdf. Figure 1.5: Probability density function of the weight of a newborn baby. The probability density function, \\(f(x)\\), is defined such that the total area under the curve is 1. \\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1 \\] The area under the curve from a to b is the probability that the random variable \\(X\\) takes a value between a and b. \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x) dx\\) The cumulative distribution function, cdf, sometimes called just the distribution function, \\(F(x)\\), is defined as: \\[F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(x) dx\\] \\[P(X \\leq x) = F(x)\\] As we know that the total probability (over all x) is 1, we can conclude that \\[P(X &gt; x) = 1 - F(x)\\] and thus \\[P(a &lt; X \\leq b) = F(b) - F(a)\\] 1.4.1 Parametric continuous distributions Two important parameters of a distribution is the expected value, \\(\\mu\\), that describe the distributions location and the variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\), that the spread. The expected value, or population mean, is defined as; \\[E[X] = \\mu = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x) dx\\] We will learn more about the expected value and how to estimate a population mean from a sample later in the course. The variance is defined as the expected value of the squared distance from the population mean; \\[\\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mu)^2 f(x) dx\\] The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). 1.4.2 Normal distribution The normal distribution (sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution) is a common probability distribution and many continuous random variables can be described by the normal distribution or be approximated by the normal distribution. The normal probability density function \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sigma} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}\\] describes the distribution of a normal random variable, \\(X\\), with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\) are two common mathematical constants, \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\) and \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\). In short we write \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\). The bell-shaped normal distributions is symmetric around \\(\\mu\\) and \\(f(x) \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and as \\(x \\rightarrow -\\infty\\). As \\(f(x)\\) is well defined, values for the cumulative distribution function \\(F(x) = \\int_{- \\infty}^x f(x) dx\\) can be computed. If \\(X\\) is normally distributed with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) we write: \\[X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\] Using transformation rules we can define \\[Z = \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}, \\, Z \\sim N(0,1)\\] Values for the cumulative standard normal distribution, \\(F(z)\\), are tabulated and easy to compute in R using the function pnorm. Figure 1.6: The shaded area under hte curve is the tabulated value \\(P(Z \\leq z) = F(z)\\). Table 1.1: Normal distribution. The table gives \\(F(z) = P(Z \\leq z)\\) for \\(Z \\in N(0,1)\\). 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.0 0.5000 0.5040 0.5080 0.5120 0.5160 0.5199 0.5239 0.5279 0.5319 0.5359 0.1 0.5398 0.5438 0.5478 0.5517 0.5557 0.5596 0.5636 0.5675 0.5714 0.5753 0.2 0.5793 0.5832 0.5871 0.5910 0.5948 0.5987 0.6026 0.6064 0.6103 0.6141 0.3 0.6179 0.6217 0.6255 0.6293 0.6331 0.6368 0.6406 0.6443 0.6480 0.6517 0.4 0.6554 0.6591 0.6628 0.6664 0.6700 0.6736 0.6772 0.6808 0.6844 0.6879 0.5 0.6915 0.6950 0.6985 0.7019 0.7054 0.7088 0.7123 0.7157 0.7190 0.7224 0.6 0.7257 0.7291 0.7324 0.7357 0.7389 0.7422 0.7454 0.7486 0.7517 0.7549 0.7 0.7580 0.7611 0.7642 0.7673 0.7704 0.7734 0.7764 0.7794 0.7823 0.7852 0.8 0.7881 0.7910 0.7939 0.7967 0.7995 0.8023 0.8051 0.8078 0.8106 0.8133 0.9 0.8159 0.8186 0.8212 0.8238 0.8264 0.8289 0.8315 0.8340 0.8365 0.8389 1.0 0.8413 0.8438 0.8461 0.8485 0.8508 0.8531 0.8554 0.8577 0.8599 0.8621 1.1 0.8643 0.8665 0.8686 0.8708 0.8729 0.8749 0.8770 0.8790 0.8810 0.8830 1.2 0.8849 0.8869 0.8888 0.8907 0.8925 0.8944 0.8962 0.8980 0.8997 0.9015 1.3 0.9032 0.9049 0.9066 0.9082 0.9099 0.9115 0.9131 0.9147 0.9162 0.9177 1.4 0.9192 0.9207 0.9222 0.9236 0.9251 0.9265 0.9279 0.9292 0.9306 0.9319 1.5 0.9332 0.9345 0.9357 0.9370 0.9382 0.9394 0.9406 0.9418 0.9429 0.9441 1.6 0.9452 0.9463 0.9474 0.9484 0.9495 0.9505 0.9515 0.9525 0.9535 0.9545 1.7 0.9554 0.9564 0.9573 0.9582 0.9591 0.9599 0.9608 0.9616 0.9625 0.9633 1.8 0.9641 0.9649 0.9656 0.9664 0.9671 0.9678 0.9686 0.9693 0.9699 0.9706 1.9 0.9713 0.9719 0.9726 0.9732 0.9738 0.9744 0.9750 0.9756 0.9761 0.9767 2.0 0.9772 0.9778 0.9783 0.9788 0.9793 0.9798 0.9803 0.9808 0.9812 0.9817 2.1 0.9821 0.9826 0.9830 0.9834 0.9838 0.9842 0.9846 0.9850 0.9854 0.9857 2.2 0.9861 0.9864 0.9868 0.9871 0.9875 0.9878 0.9881 0.9884 0.9887 0.9890 2.3 0.9893 0.9896 0.9898 0.9901 0.9904 0.9906 0.9909 0.9911 0.9913 0.9916 2.4 0.9918 0.9920 0.9922 0.9925 0.9927 0.9929 0.9931 0.9932 0.9934 0.9936 2.5 0.9938 0.9940 0.9941 0.9943 0.9945 0.9946 0.9948 0.9949 0.9951 0.9952 2.6 0.9953 0.9955 0.9956 0.9957 0.9959 0.9960 0.9961 0.9962 0.9963 0.9964 2.7 0.9965 0.9966 0.9967 0.9968 0.9969 0.9970 0.9971 0.9972 0.9973 0.9974 2.8 0.9974 0.9975 0.9976 0.9977 0.9977 0.9978 0.9979 0.9979 0.9980 0.9981 2.9 0.9981 0.9982 0.9982 0.9983 0.9984 0.9984 0.9985 0.9985 0.9986 0.9986 3.0 0.9987 0.9987 0.9987 0.9988 0.9988 0.9989 0.9989 0.9989 0.9990 0.9990 3.1 0.9990 0.9991 0.9991 0.9991 0.9992 0.9992 0.9992 0.9992 0.9993 0.9993 3.2 0.9993 0.9993 0.9994 0.9994 0.9994 0.9994 0.9994 0.9995 0.9995 0.9995 3.3 0.9995 0.9995 0.9995 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9997 3.4 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9998 Some value of particular interest: \\[F(1.64) = 0.95\\\\ F(1.96) = 0.975\\] As the normal distribution is symmetric F(-z) = 1 - F(z) \\[F(-1.64) = 0.05\\\\ F(-1.96) = 0.025\\] \\[P(-1.96 &lt; Z &lt; 1.96) = 0.95\\] 1.4.2.1 Sum of two normal random variables If \\(X \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1)\\) and \\(Y \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2)\\) are two independent normal random variables, then their sum is also a random variable: \\[X + Y \\sim N(\\mu_1 + \\mu_2, \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2})\\] and \\[X - Y \\sim N(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2})\\] This can be extended to the case with \\(n\\) independent and identically distributed random varibles \\(X_i\\) (\\(i=1 \\dots n\\)). If all \\(X_i\\) are normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), \\(X_i \\in N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\), then the sum of all \\(n\\) random variables will also be normally distributed with mean \\(n\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{n} \\sigma\\). 1.4.3 Central limit theorem Theorem 1.1 The sum of \\(n\\) independent and equally distributed random variables is normally distributed, if \\(n\\) is large enough. As a result of central limit theorem, the distribution of fractions or mean values of a sample follow the normal distribution, at least if the sample is large enough (a rule of thumb is that the sample size \\(n&gt;30\\)). Example 1.4 (Mean BMI) In a population of 252 men we can study the distribution of BMI. ##Population mean (mu &lt;- mean(fat$BMI)) ## [1] 25 ##Population variance (sigma2 &lt;- var(fat$BMI)/nrow(fat)*(nrow(fat)-1)) ## [1] 13 ##Population standard variance (sigma &lt;- sqrt(sigma2)) ## [1] 3.6 Randomly sample 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 men and compute the mean value, \\(m\\). Repeat many times to get the distribution of mean values.

Ex: dead/alive, healthy/sick, WT/mutant, AA/Aa/aa, male/female, red/green/blue Ordinal: named and ordered. Ex: pain (weak, moderate, severe), AA/Aa/aa, very young/young/middle age/old/very old, grade I, II, III, IV Reported as frequencies, proportions, summarized using mode Quantitative (numeric) Discrete: finite or countable infinite values. Ex. counts, number of cells, number of reads Continuous: infinitely many uncountable values. Ex. height, weight, concentration Useful summary statistics include mean, median, variance, standard deviation. 2.2 Measures of location Mode: the most common value, can be computed also for categorical data Median: The value that divide the ordered data values into two equally sized groups. 50% of the values are below the median. Mean: the arithmetic mean, also called the average 2.2.1 Expected value The expected value of a random variable, or the population mean, is \\[\\mu = E[X] = \\frac{1}{N}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i,\\] where the sum is over all \\(N\\) data points in the population. The above formula is probably the most intuitive for finite populations, but for infinite populations other definitions can be used. For a discrete random variable: \\[\\mu = E[X] = \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K x_k p(x_k),\\] where the sum is taken over all possible outcomes. For a continuous random variable: \\[\\mu = E[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x) dx\\] 2.2.1.1 Linear transformations and combinations \\[E(aX) = a E(X)\\] \\[E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)\\] \\[E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]\\] Note, several very different distributions can still have the same mean value.

First quartile. 25% of the values are below Q1. Divides the values below the median into equally sized groups. Q2.´ Second quartile. 50% of the values are below Q2. Q2 is the median. Q3. Third quartile. 75% of the values are below Q3. Divides the values above the median into equally sized groups. IQR: interquartile range: Q3 - Q1 Variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). The variance is the mean squared distance from the mean value. Standard deviation, \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\). 2.3.1 Variance and standard deviation The variance of a random variable, the population variance, is defined as \\[\\sigma^2 = var(X) = E[(X-\\mu)^2]\\] \\[\\sigma^2 = var(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x-\\mu)^2,\\] where the sum is over all \\(N\\) data points in the population. \\[\\sigma^2 = var(X) = E[(X-\\mu)^2] = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K (x_k-\\mu)^2 p(x_k) &amp; \\textrm{if }X\\textrm{ discrete} \\\\ \\\\ \\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mu)^2 f(x) dx &amp; \\textrm{if }X\\textrm{ continuous} \\end{array}\\right.\\] Standard deviation \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{var(X)}\\] 2.3.1.1 Linear transformations and combinations \\[var(aX) = a^2 var(X)\\] For independent random variables X and Y \\[var(aX + bY) = a^2var(X) + b^2var(Y)\\] 2.4 Random sample In many (most) experiments it is not feasible (or even possible) to examine the entire population. Instead we study a random sample. A random sample is a random subset of individuals from a population. A simple random sample is a random subset of individuals from a population, where every individual has the same probability of being choosen. Notation A random sample \\(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\) from a distribution, \\(D\\), consists of \\(n\\) observations of the independent random variables \\(X_1, X_2,\\dots,X_n\\) all with the distribution \\(D\\). 2.4.1 The urn model to perform simple random sampling Let every individual in the population be represented by a ball. The value on each ball is the measurement we are interested in, for example height, shoe size, hair color, healthy/sick, type of cancer/no cancer, blood glucose value, etc. Draw \\(n\\) balls from the urn, without replacement, to get a random sample of size \\(n\\). 2.4.2 Sample properties Summary statistics can be computed for a sample, such as the sum, proportion, mean and variance. 2.4.2.1 Sample proportion The proportion of a population with a particular property is \\(\\pi\\). The number of individuals with the property in a simple random sample of size \\(n\\) is a random variable \\(X\\). The proportion of individuals in a sample with the property is also a random variable; \\[P = \\frac{X}{n}\\] with expected value \\[E[P] = \\frac{E[X]}{n} = \\frac{n\\pi}{n} = \\pi\\] 2.4.3 Sample mean and standard deviation For a particular sample of size \\(n\\); \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\), the sample mean is denoted \\(m = \\bar x\\). The sample mean is calculated as; \\[m = \\bar x = \\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\] and the sample variance as; \\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x-m)^2\\] Note that the mean of \\(n\\) independent identically distributed random variables, \\(X_i\\) is itself a random variable; \\[\\bar X = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i,\\] If \\(X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\) then \\(\\bar X \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\). When we only have a sample of size \\(n\\), the sample mean \\(m\\) is our best estimate of the population mean. It is possible to show that the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean, i.e. the average (over many size \\(n\\) samples) of the sample mean is \\(\\mu\\). \\[E[\\bar X] = \\frac{1}{n} n E[X] = E[X] = \\mu\\] Similarly, the sample variance is an unbiased estimate of the population variance. 2.4.4 Standard error Eventhough the sample can be used to calculate unbiased estimates of the population value, the sample estimate will not be perfect. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (the distribution of sample estimates) is called the standard error. For the sample mean, \\(\\bar X\\), the variance is \\[E[(\\bar X - \\mu)] = var(\\bar X) = var(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_i var(X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2} n var(X) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\] The standard error of the mean is thus; \\[SEM = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Replacing \\(\\sigma\\) with the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), we get an estimate of the standard deviation of the mean; \\[SEM \\approx \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] An alternative definition of standard error of the mean is actually \\[SEM = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] 2.5 Exercises Exercise 2.1 Data summary Consider the below data and summarize each of the variables. id smoker baby weight (kg) gender mother weight (kg) mother age parity married 1 yes 2.8 F 64 21 2 yes 2 yes 3.2 M 65 27 1 yes 3 yes 3.5 F 64 31 2 yes 4 yes 2.7 F 73 32 0 yes 5 yes 3.3 M 59 39 3 yes 6 no 3.7 F 61 26 0 no 7 no 3.3 F 52 27 2 no 8 no 4.3 F 59 21 0 no 9 no 3.2 M 65 28 1 no 10 no 3.0 M 73 33 4 yes Exercise 2.2 (Exercise in distribution of sample mean) The total cholesterol in population (mg/dL) is normally distributed with \\(\\mu = 202\\) and \\(\\sigma = 40\\). a.

Typicaly, the hypotheses that are tested are assumptions about properties of the population, such as proportion, mean, mean difference, variance etc. 3.1.1 The null and alternative hypothesis There are two hypotheses involved in a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\), and the alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1\\). The null hypothesis is in general neutral, “no change”, “no difference between groups”, “no association”. In general we want to show that \\(H_0\\) is false. The alternative hypothesis expresses what the researcher is interested in “the treatment has an effect”, “there is a difference between groups”, “there is an association”. The alternative hypothesis can also be directional “the treatment has a positive effect”. 3.1.2 To perform a hypothesis test Define \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) Select appropriate test statistic, \\(T\\), and compute the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\) Assume that the \\(H_0\\) is true and compute the sampling distribution of \\(T\\). Select an appropriate significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) Compare the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\), with the computed sampling distribution under \\(H_0\\) and compute a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the observed value, if \\(H_0\\) is true. Based on the p-value either accept or reject \\(H_0\\). Definition 3.1 Sampling distribution A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic of a large number of samples drawn from a specific population. Definition 3.2 Null distribution The null distribution is a sampling distribution when the null hypothesis is true. Figure 3.1: A null distribution Definition 3.3 p-value The p-value is the probability of the observed value, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. Figure 3.2: The p-value is the probability to observe \\(x_{obs}\\) or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. 3.1.3 Significance level and error types H0 is true H0 is false Accept H0 Type II error, miss Reject H0 Type I error, false alarm The significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) = P(false alarm) = P(Reject \\(H_0\\)|\\(H_0\\) is true). The significance level is the risk to of false alarm, i.e. to say “I have a hit”, “I found a difference”, when the the null hypothesis (“there is no difference”) is true. The risk of false alarm is controll by setting the significance level to a disired value. We do want to keep the risk of false alarm (type I error) low, but at the same time we don’t want to many missed hits (type II error). The significance level should be set before the hypothesis test is performed. Common values to use are 0.05 or 0.01. If the p-value is above the significance level, \\(H_0\\) is accepted. If the p-value is below the significance level, \\(H_0\\) is rejected. 3.1.4 Hypothesis test, simulation examples In these examples the significance level is set to 0.05. Example 3.1 (Simulation example) Pollen allergy Let’s assume we know that the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden is \\(0.3\\). We suspect that the number of pollen allergic has increased in Uppsala in the last couple of years and want to investigate this. Observe 100 people from Uppsala, 42 of these were allergic to pollen. Is there a reason to believe that the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala \\(\\pi &gt; 0.3\\)? Null and alternative hypotheses \\(H_0:\\) The proportion of pollen allergy in Uppsala is the same as in Sweden as a whole. \\(H_1:\\) The proportion of pollen allergy in Uppsala is not the same as in Sweden as a whole. or expressed differently; \\[H_0:\\, \\pi=\\pi_0\\] \\[H_1:\\, \\pi&gt;\\pi_0\\] where \\(\\pi\\) is the unknown proportion of pollen allergy in the Uppsala population that. \\(\\pi_0 = 0.3\\) is the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden. Test statistic Here we are interested in the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala. An appropriate test statistic could be the number of pollen allergic in a sample of size \\(n=100\\), \\(X\\). As an alternative we can use the proportion of pollen allergic in a sample of size \\(n\\), \\[P = \\frac{X}{n}\\] Let’s use \\(P\\) as our test statistic and compute the observed value, \\(p_{obs}\\). In our sample of 100 people from Uppsala the proportion allergic to pollen is \\(p=42/100=0.42\\). Null distribution The sampling distribution of \\(P\\) under \\(H_0\\) (i.e. when the null hypothesis is true) is what we call the null distribution. \\(H_0\\) state that \\(\\pi=0.3\\). We can model this using an urn model as follows; Figure 3.3: An urn model of the null hypothesis \\(\\pi=0.3\\). The black balls represent allergic and the white balls non-allergic. Using this model, we can simulate taking a sample of size 100 many times. ## Urn rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ## Sample 100 times with replacement sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE) ## [1] 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ## [38] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ## [75] 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Compute proportion of samples that are allergic (1) sum(sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE))/100 ## [1] 0.34 ## Draw samples of size 100 and compute proporion allergic 100000 times p &lt;- replicate(100000, mean(sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE))) Finally plot the distribution Figure 3.4: The sampling distribution. Compute p-value Compare the observed value, \\(p_{obs} = 0.42\\) to the null distribution. Figure 3.5: The sampling distribution. The observed value is marked by a red vertical line. The p-value is the probability of getting the observed value or higher, if the null hypothesis is true. Use the null distribution to calculate the p-value, \\(P(P \\geq 0.42|H_0)\\). ## How many times sum(p &gt;= 0.42) ## [1] 711 ## p-value sum(p &gt;= 0.42)/length(p) ## [1] 0.0071 p = \\(P(P \\geq 0.42|H_0)\\) = 0.00711 Accept or reject \\(H_0\\)? Example 3.2 (Permutation test) Do high fat diet lead to increased body weight? Study setup: Order 24 female mice from a lab. Randomly assign 12 of the 24 mice to receive high-fat diet, the remaining 12 are controls (ordinary diet). Measure body weight after one week. Null and alternative hypotheses \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0: \\mu_2 = \\mu_1 \\iff \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 = 0\\\\ H_1: \\mu_2&gt;\\mu_1 \\iff \\mu_2-\\mu_1 &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\mu_2\\) is the (unknown) mean body weight of the high-fat mouse population and \\(\\mu_1\\) is the mean body-weight of the control mouse population. Studied population: Female mice that can be ordered from a lab. Test statistic Here we are interested in the mean difference between high-fat and control mice. Mean weight of 12 (randomly selected) mice on ordinary diet, \\(\\bar X_1\\). \\(E[\\bar X_1] = E[X_1] = \\mu_1\\) Mean weight of 12 (randomly selected) mice on high-fat diet, \\(\\bar X_2\\). \\(E[\\bar X_2] = E[X_2] = \\mu_2\\) The mean difference is also a random variable: \\(D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1\\) The observed values, mouse weights in grams, are summarized below; high-fat 25 30 23 18 31 24 39 26 36 29 24 32 ordinary 27 25 22 23 25 37 24 26 22 26 30 24 Mean weight of control mice (ordinary diet): \\(\\bar x_1 = 25.83\\) Mean weight of mice on high-fat diet: \\(\\bar x_2 = 28.00\\) Difference in mean weights: \\(d_{obs} = \\bar x_2 - \\bar x_1 = 2.17\\) Null distribution If high-fat diet has no effect, i.e. if \\(H_0\\) was true, the result would be as if all mice were given the same diet. What can we expect if all mice are fed with the same type of food? This can be accomplished using permutation The 24 mice were initially from the same population, depending on how the mice are randomly assigned to high-fat and normal group, the mean weights would differ, even if the two groups were treated the same. Assume \\(H_0\\) is true, i.e. assume all mice are equivalent and Randomly reassign 12 of the 24 mice to ‘high-fat’ and the remaining 12 to ‘control’. Compute difference in mean weights If we repeat 1-2 many times we get the sampling distribution when \\(H_0\\) is true, the so called null distribution, of difference in mean weights. Compute p-value What is the probability to get an at least as extreme mean difference as our observed value, \\(d_{obs}\\), if \\(H_0\\) was true? $P(X_2 - X_2 d_{obs} | H_0) = $0.126 Conclusion? 3.2 Parametric distributions In previous chapters we have computed the sampling distribution using resampling techniques to be able to perform hypothesis tests or compute interval estimates. If the null distribution was already known (or could be computed based on a few assumptions) resampling would not be necessary. We can follow the same steps as before to perform a hypothesis test: Define \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) Select appropriate test statistic, \\(T\\), and compute the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\) Assume that the \\(H_0\\) and derive the null distribution of the test statistic based on appropriate assumptions. Select an appropriate significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) Compare the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\), with the null distribution and compute a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the observed value, if \\(H_0\\) is true. Based on the p-value either accept or reject \\(H_0\\). 3.2.1 One sample, proportions Example 3.3 Let’s get back to the pollen example! Assume that the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden is known to be \\(0.3\\). Observe 100 people from Uppsala, 42 of these were allergic to pollen. Is there a reason to believe that the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala \\(\\pi &gt; 0.3\\)? The number of allergic individuals in a sample of size \\(n\\) is \\(X\\) and the proportion of allergic persons is \\(P = X/n\\). \\(X\\) is binomially distributed, but here we can use the Central limit theorem, see 1.1. Theorem 3.1 The sum of \\(n\\) independent and equally distributed random variables is normally distributed, if \\(n\\) is large enough. As a result of the central limit theorem, the distribution of number or proportion of allergic individuals in a sample of size \\(n\\) is approximately normal. At least if the sample is large enough. A rule of thumb is that the sample size should be \\(n&gt;30\\). Here, the sample size is 100! The normal distribution has two parameters, mean and standard deviation. From the binomial distribution we know that \\(E[X] = \\pi\\) and \\(var(X) = n\\pi(1-\\pi)\\). Hence \\(E[P] = \\pi\\) and \\(var(P) = \\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}\\). The standard error is thus \\[SE=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\] When the null hypothesis is true \\(\\pi\\) is known and \\(\\pi=0.3\\). Actually these calculations are true in general when a proportion in one sample is compared to a known value. \\[H_0: \\pi=\\pi_0 \\\\ H_1: \\pi&gt;\\pi_0 \\] Ather potential alternative hypothesis are \\(H_1: \\pi&lt;\\pi_0\\) or \\(H_1:\\pi \\neq \\pi_0\\), but in this particular xample we are only interested in the alternative that \\(\\pi &gt; \\pi_0\\). If \\(H_0\\) is true \\(\\pi=\\pi_0\\) and \\[P \\sim N\\left(\\pi_0, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}\\right)\\] An appropriate test statistic is \\[Z = \\frac{P-\\pi_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}}\\] \\(Z \\in N(0,1)\\) which makes probabilities easy to compute. Back to our example, replace \\(P\\) with our observed value \\(p=0.42\\) and \\(\\pi_0=0.3\\) and compute our observed \\[Z_{obs} = \\frac{0.42-0.3}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{100}}} = 2.62\\] The p-value is the probability of the observed value, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. If the computed probability is below \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) our significance threshold, \\(H_0\\) will be rejected. \\[p = P(P&gt;\\pi_0) = P(Z&gt;Z_{obs}) = P(Z&gt;2.62) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 2.62) = [table] = 1 - 0.996 = 0.0044\\] As 0.0044&lt;0.05 we reject \\(H_0\\) and conclude that there is reason to believe that the proportion of allergic in Uppsala is greater than 0.3. 3.2.2 One sample, mean A one sample test of means compares the mean of a sample to a prespecified value. For example, we might know that the weight of a mouse on normal diet is normally distributed with mean 24.0 g and standard deviation 3 g and want to compare the weight of a sample of 10 mice on high-fat diet to the known mean value for mice on normal diet. The hypotheses: \\[ H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0 \\\\ H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\] The alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1,\\) above is for the two sided hypothesis test. Other options are the one sided \\(H_1\\); \\(H_1: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\) or \\(H_1: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\\). If \\[X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\] (this could for example be the weight of a mouse on high-fat diet) then the sample mean \\[\\bar X \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\]. If \\(\\sigma\\) is known the test statistic \\[Z = \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\] is normally distributed, \\(\\sim N(0,1)\\). For small \\(n\\) and unknown \\(\\sigma\\), the test statistic \\[t = \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\] is t-distributed with \\(df=n-1\\) degrees of freedom. 3.2.3 Two samples, proportions \\[H_0: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 = 0\\\\ H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 \\neq 0\\] Alternatively, a one sided alternative hypothesis can be used; \\(H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 &gt;0\\) or \\(H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 &lt; 0\\). Test statistic \\[Z = \\frac{P_1 - P_2}{\\sqrt{P(1-P)\\left (\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}}\\] where \\(P\\) is the proportion in the merged sample of size \\(n_1 + n_2\\). \\(Z \\in N(0,1)\\) and p-value can be computed using the standard normal distribution. 3.2.4 Two samples, mean A two sample test of means is used to determine if two population means are equal. Two independent samples are collected (one from each population) and the means are compared. Can for example be used to determine if a treatment group is different compared to a control group, in terms of the mean of a property of interest. The null hypothesis; \\[H_0: \\mu_2 = \\mu_1\\] The alternative hypothesis can either be two sided \\[H_1: \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_1\\] or one sided \\[H_1: \\mu_2 &gt; \\mu_1\\] or \\[H_1: \\mu_2 &lt; \\mu_1\\] Assume that observations from both populations are normally distributed; \\[ \\begin{aligned} X_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1) \\\\ X_2 \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2) \\end{aligned} \\] Then it follows that the sample means will also be normally distributed; \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\bar X_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1/\\sqrt{n_1}) \\\\ \\bar X_2 \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2/\\sqrt{n_2}) \\end{aligned} \\] The mean difference \\(D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1\\) is thus also normally distributed: \\[D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1 = N\\left(\\mu_2-\\mu_1, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}\\right)\\] If \\(H_0\\) is true: \\[D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1 = N\\left(0, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}\\right)\\] The test statistic: \\[Z = \\frac{\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}}\\] is standard normal, i.e. \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\). However, note that the test statistic require the standard deviations \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) to be known. What if the population standard deviations are not known? If the sample sizes are large, we can replace the known standard deviations with our sample standard deviations and according to the central limit theorem assume that \\[Z = \\frac{\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}}} \\sim N(0,1)\\] and proceed as before. For small sample sizes the test statistic will be t-distributed. \\[t = \\frac{\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}}}\\] For small sample sizes we can use Student’s t-test, which requires us to assume that \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) both are normally distributed and have equal variances. With these assumptions we can compute the pooled variance \\[ s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2} \\] and the test statistic \\[t = \\frac{\\bar X_1 - \\bar X_2}{\\sqrt{s_p^2(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}}\\] \\(t\\) is t-distributed with \\(n_1+n_2-2\\) degrees of freedom. The t-test is implemented in R, e.g. in the function t.test in the R-package stats, both Student’s t-test with equal variances and Welch’s t-test with unequal variances. 3.2.5 Variance The test of equal variance in two groups is based on the null hypothesis \\[H_0: \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2\\] If the two samples both come from two populations with normal distributions, the sample variances \\[S_1^2 = \\frac{1}{n_1-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (X_{1i}-\\bar X_1)^2\\\\ S_2^2 = \\frac{1}{n_2-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_2} (X_{2i}-\\bar X_2)^2\\] It can be shown that \\(\\frac{(n_1-1)S_1^2}{\\sigma_1^2} ~ \\chi^2(n_1-1)\\) and \\(\\frac{(n_2-1)S_2^2}{\\sigma_2^2} ~ \\chi^2(n_2-1)\\). Hence, the test statistic for comparing the variances of two groups \\[F = \\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}\\] is \\(F\\) is F-distributed with \\(n_1-1\\) and \\(n_2-1\\) degrees of freedom. In R a test of equal variances can be performred using the function var.test. 3.2.6 Exercises Exercise 3.1 The hemoglobin value (Hb) in women is on average 140 g/L. You observe the following Hb values in a set of five men: 154, 140, 147, 162, 172. Assume that Hb is normally distributed. Is there a reason to believe that the mean Hb value in men differ from that in women? Exercise 3.2 In order to study the effect of high-fat diet 12 mice are fed normal diet (control group) and 12 mice are fed high-fat diet. After a couple of weeks the mouse weights in gram are recorded; high-fat 25 30 23 18 31 24 39 26 36 29 23 32 ordinary 27 25 22 23 25 37 24 26 21 26 30 24 Does high fat diet increase body weight in mice? Assume equal variances. # Student&#39;s t-test with pooled variances t.test(xHF, xN, var.equal=TRUE, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;) Don’t assume equal variances. # Unequal variances with Welch approximation to the degrees of freedom (the default) t.test(xHF, xN, var.equal=FALSE, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;) 3.3 Point and interval estimates As seen in previous chapter, the sample proportion or mean is an unbiased estimate of the population values. When we only have a sample, the sample estimate will be our best guess of the population value, but it will not be without error. If we are interested in how large proportion of the Uppsala population is allergic to pollen, we can investigate this by studying a random sample. Randomly select 100 persons in Uppsala. It is important to actually sample randomly, ideally every individual should have the same probability of being sampled. In our sample, we observe that 42 of the 100 has a pollen allergy. Hence, the observed sample proportion is \\(p=0.42\\). Based on this observation our point estimate of the Uppsla popultation proportion \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi \\approx p = 0.42\\). We know that there is a certain uncertainty in this measurement, if the experiment is repeated we would select 100 other persons and our point estimate would be slihtly different. 3.3.1 Bootstrap interval Using bootstrap we can sample with replacement from our sample to estimate the uncertainty. Bootstrap is to use the data we have (our sample) and sample repeatedly with replacement from this data. Put the entire sample in an urn! Figure 3.6: An urn model with 42 allergy (black) and 58 non-allergy (white). The black balls represent allergic and the white balls non-allergic. Sample from the urn with replacement to compute the bootstrap distribution. Using the bootstrap distribution the uncertainty of our estimate of \\(\\pi\\) can be estimated. The 95% bootstrap interval is [0.24, 0.42]. The bootstrap is very useful if you do not know the distribution of our sampled propery. But in our example we actually do. 3.3.2 Confidence interval A confidence interval is a type of interval estimate associated with a confidence level. 3.3.2.1 Confidence interval of proportions Remember that we can use the central limit theorem to show that \\[P \\sim N\\left(\\pi, SE\\right) \\iff P \\sim \\left(\\pi, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\right)\\] It follows that \\[Z = \\frac{P - \\pi}{SE} \\sim N(0,1)\\] Based on what we know of the standard normal distribution, we can compute an interval around the population property \\(\\pi\\) such that the probability that a sample property \\(p\\) fall within this interval is \\(1-\\alpha\\). \\[P(-z &lt; \\frac{P - \\pi}{SE} &lt; z) = 1 - \\alpha\\] For a 95% confidence interval z=1.96 (from a table of the standard normal distribution). Other confidence levels of interest include 90% (z=1.64) and 99% (z=2.58). \\[P\\left(-z &lt; \\frac{P-\\pi}{SE}&lt;z\\right) = \\left(-z &lt; Z &lt;z\\right) = 1-\\alpha\\] We can rewrite this to \\[P\\left(\\pi-z SE &lt; P &lt; \\pi + z SE\\right) = 1-\\alpha\\] in other words sample fraction \\(p\\) will fall between \\(\\pi \\pm 1.96 SE\\) with 95% probability. The equation can also be rewritten to \\[P\\left(P-z SE &lt; \\pi &lt; P + z SE\\right) = 1 - \\alpha\\] The observed confidence interval is what we get when we replace the random variable \\(P\\) with our observed fraction, \\[p-z SE &lt; \\pi &lt; p + z SE\\] \\[\\pi = p \\pm z SE = p \\pm z \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] The 95% confidence interval \\[\\pi = p \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] A 95% confidence interval will have 95% chance to cover the true value. Back to our example of proportion pollen allergic in Uppsala. \\(p=0.33\\) and \\(SE=\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = 0.05\\). Hence, the 95% confidence interval is \\[\\pi = 0.33 \\pm 1.96 * 0.05 = 0.33 \\pm 0.092\\] or \\[(0.33-0.092, 0.33+0.092) = (0.24, 0.42)\\] Exercise 3.3 a) How can we get a narrower confidence interval? b) Here we computed a 95% interval, what if we want a 90% confidence interval? c) or a 99% confidence interval? 3.3.2.1.1 Confidence interval of mean The confidence interval of mean can be derived similarly. The mean of a sample of \\(n\\) independent and identically normal distributed observations \\(X_i\\) is normally distributed; \\[\\bar X \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\] If \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown the statistic \\[\\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\sim t(n-1)\\] is t-distributed with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. It follows that \\[ \\begin{aligned} P\\left(-t &lt; \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} &lt; t\\right) = 1 - \\alpha \\iff \\\\ P\\left(\\bar X - t \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &lt; \\mu &lt; \\bar X + t \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 1 - \\alpha \\end{aligned} \\] The confidence interval with confidence level \\(1-\\alpha\\) is thus; \\[\\mu = \\bar x \\pm t \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] For a 95% confidence interval and \\(n=5\\) \\(t\\) is 2.78. The \\(t\\) values for different values of \\(\\alpha\\) and degrees of freedom are tabulated and can be computed in R using the function qt. ## [1] 2.8 Exercise 3.4 You measure the Hb value in 10 50 year old men and get the following observations; 145, 165, 134, 167, 158, 176, 156, 189, 143, 123. Compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean Hb value. "],

Objections: too conservative 4.3 Benjamini-Hochbegs FDR H0 is true H0 is false Accept H0 TN FN Reject H0 FP TP The false discovery rate is the proportion of false positives among ‘hits’, i.e. \\(\\frac{FP}{TP+FP}\\). Benjamini-Hochberg’s method control the FDR level, \\(\\gamma\\), when performing \\(m\\) independent tests, as follows: Sort the p-values \\(p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq p_m\\). Find the maximum \\(j\\) such that \\(p_j \\leq \\gamma \\frac{j}{m}\\). Declare significance for all tests \\(1, 2, \\dots, j\\). 4.4 ‘Adjusted’ p-values Sometimes an adjusted significance threshold is not reported, but instead ‘adjusted’ p-values are reported. Using Bonferroni’s method the adjusted p-values are: \\(\\tilde p_i = \\min(m p_i, 1)\\). A feature’s adjusted p-value represents the smallest FWER at which the null hypothesis will be rejected, i.e. the feature will be deemed significant. Benjamini-Hochberg’s ‘adjusted’ p-values are called \\(q\\)-values: \\(q_i = \\min(\\frac{m}{i} p_i, 1)\\) A feature’s \\(q\\)-value can be interpreted as the lowest FDR at which the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected, i.e. the feature will be deemed significant. 4.5 Example, 10000 independent tests (e.g. genes) p-value adj p (Bonferroni) q-value (B-H) 1.7e-08 0.00 0.00 5.8e-08 0.00 0.00 3.4e-07 0.00 0.00 9.1e-07 0.01 0.00 1e-06 0.01 0.00 2.4e-06 0.02 0.00 2.3e-05 0.23 0.03 3.6e-05 0.36 0.04 0.00022 1.00 0.23 0.00023 1.00 0.23 0.00073 1.00 0.66 0.0032 1.00 1.00 0.0045 1.00 1.00 0.0087 1.00 1.00 0.0089 1.00 1.00 0.012 1.00 1.00 0.014 1.00 1.00 0.045 1.00 1.00 0.08 1.00 1.00 0.23 1.00 1.00 "]
