# Probability theory

Learning outcomes

- understand the concept of random variables and probability
- understand and learn to use resampling to compute probabilities

## Random variables

The outcome of a random experiment can be described by a *random variable*.

Whenever chance is involved in the outcome of an experiment the outcome is a random variable.

A random variable can not be predicted exactly, but the probability of all possible outcomes can be described.

A random variable is usually denoted by a capital letter, $X, Y, Z, \dots$. Values collected in an experiment are *observations* of the random variable, usually denoted by lowercase letters $x, y, z, \dots$.

The *population* is the collection of all possible observations of the random variable. Note, the population is not always countable.

A *sample* is a subset of the population.

Example random variables:

- The weight of a random newborn baby
- The smoking status of a random mother
- The hemoglobin concentration in blood
- The number of mutations in a gene
- BMI of a random man
- Weight status of a random man (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese)
- The result of throwing a die

### Discrete random variables

A discrete random number has countable number of outcomes values, such as {1,2,3,4,5,6}; {red, blue, green}; {tiny, small, average, large, huge} or all integers.

A discrete random variable can be described by its *probability mass function*, pmf.

The probability that the random variable, $X$, takes the value $x$ is denoted $P(X=x) = p(x)$. Note that:
  
1. $0 \leq p(x) \leq 1$, a probability is always between 0 and 1.
2. $\sum p(x) = 1$, the sum over all possible outcomes is 1.

**Example 1** The number of dots on a die

When rolling a die the there are six possible outcomes; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, each of which have the same probability, if the die is fair. The outcome of one dice roll can be described by a random variable $X$. The probability of a particular outcome $x$ is denoted $P(X=x)$ or $p(x)$. 

The probability mass function of a fair six-sided die can be summarized in a table;

```{r}
kable(matrix(c(1:6,rep(1/6,6)),ncol=6, byrow=TRUE, dimnames=list(c('x','p(x)'), c()))) %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

or in a barplot;

```{r die, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Probability mass function of a die.", out.width="45%", fig.align='center'}
plot(data.frame(x=1:6, p=1/6) %>% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=p)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme_bw() + ylim(c(0,.25)))
``` 

**Example 2.** The smoking status of a random mother

The random variable has two possible outcomes; non-smoker (0) and smoker (1). The probability of a random mother being a smoker is 0.39.

```{r}
kable(matrix(c("0","0.61","1","0.39"),ncol=2, dimnames=list(c('x','p(x)'), c('non-smoker','smoker')))) %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

**Example 3** The number of bacterial colonies on a plate

```{r CFU, fig.cap="Probability mass distribution of the number of bacterial colonies on an agar plate.", fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
x=1:50
ggplot(data.frame(x=x, fx=dpois(x, lambda=25)), aes(x,fx)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme_bw() + ylab("p(x)")
```

### Continuous random variable

A continuous random number is not limited to discrete values, but any continuous number within one or several ranges is possible.

Examples: weight, height, speed, intensity, ...

A continuous random variable can be described by its *probability density function*, pdf.

```{r, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Probability density function of the weight of a newborn baby.", fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
# ounce <- 0.0283495231
# pound <- 0.45359237
# ggplot(babies, aes(x=wt*ounce)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density() #+ ggtitle("Weight (kg) of a newborn baby"))
#plot(ggplot(fat, aes(x=weight*pound)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density() + ggtitle("Weight (kg) of a man"))
##Simulate weights
baby <- data.frame(smoke=sample(1000, x=0:2, prob=c(0.45,0.45,0.1), replace=TRUE)) %>% mutate(m=c(3.4, 3.0, 2.5)[smoke+1], wt=rnorm(n(), mean=m, sd=0.5))
ggplot(baby, aes(x=wt)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density() 
```

```{r normpdf2, out.width="70%", fig.align="center", eval=FALSE}
x <- seq(-4,4,.01)
ggplot(data.frame(x=x, fx=dnorm(x)), aes(x,fx)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + ylab("f(x)")
```

  The probability density function, $f(x)$, is defined such that the total area under the curve is 1.

$$
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1
$$
  
  ```{r wtbabiesdens3, out.width="49%", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.keep="all"}
ggplot(baby, aes(x=wt)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density() 
#plot(ggplot(data.frame(w=wt), aes(x=w)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density())

df.wt <- density(baby$wt)
df.wt <- data.frame(x=df.wt$x, y=df.wt$y)
plot(ggplot(baby, aes(x=wt)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density() + geom_area(data=df.wt %>% filter(x<3.75, x>2.33), aes(x=x, y=y)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2,2.33,3,3.75,4,5), labels=c('2','a','3','b','4','5')) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + theme(panel.grid=element_blank()))
#plot(ggplot(data.frame(w=wt), aes(x=w)) + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_density() + geom_area(data=df.wt %>% filter(x<3.75, x>2.33), aes(x=x, y=y)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2,2.33,3,3.75,4,5), labels=c('2','a','3','b','4','5')) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + theme(panel.grid=element_blank()))
```

```{r pdfwtnorm, out.width="100%", eval=TRUE}
w<-seq(1.5,5.5,.01)
df.nwt <- data.frame(w=w, f=dnorm(w, 3.5, 0.5))
#ggplot(df.nwt, aes(x=w, y=f)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + xlab("Weight (kg)") + ylab("f(x)")
```

```{r pdfab, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(df.nwt, aes(x=w, y=f)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + xlab("Weight (kg)") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_area(data=df.nwt %>% filter(w<3.75, w>2.33)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2,2.33,3,3.75,4,5), labels=c('2','a','3','b','4','5')) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + theme(panel.grid=element_blank())
```

The area under the curve from a to b is the probability that the random variable $X$ takes a value between a and b.

$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx$
  
<!-- #### Cumulative distribution function, cdf -->
  
The *cumulative distribution function*, cdf, sometimes called just the
distribution function, $F(x)$, is defined as:
  
  $$F(x) = P(X<x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(x) dx$$
  
  ```{r wtpdfcdf, out.width="49%", fig.show="hold"}
plot(ggplot(df.nwt, aes(x=w, y=f)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + xlab("x") + ylab("f(x)") + geom_area(data=df.nwt %>% filter(w<4.0)) + annotate("label",label=sprintf("P(X<4.0) = F(4.0) = %.2f", pnorm(4,3.5,0.5)), x=2.7, y=0.4, hjust=0))
df.nwt$F <- pnorm(df.nwt$w, 3.5, 0.5)
plot(ggplot(df.nwt, aes(x=w, y=F)) + geom_line() + xlab("x") + ylab("F(x)") + theme_bw() + geom_point(aes(x=4, y=pnorm(4,3.5,.5))) + annotate("label",label=sprintf("F(4.0)=%.2f", pnorm(4,3.5,.5)), x=4, y=.84, hjust=-0.2))##+ ggtitle("Cumulative distribution function") 
```

$$P(X<x) = F(x)$$
  
  As we know that the total probability (over all x) is 1, we can conclude that 

$$P(X \geq x) = 1 - F(x)$$
  and thus

$$P(a \leq X < b) = F(b) - F(a)$$

## Simulate distributions

As seen in previous chapter, once the distribution is known, we can compute probabilities, such as $P(X=x), P(X<x)$ and $P(X \geq x)$. If the distribution is not known, simulation might be the solution.

```{example, "Simulate coin toss", echo=TRUE}
In a single coin toss the probabity of heads is 0.5. In 20 coin tosses, what is the probability of at least 15 heads?
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A coin toss. Urn model with one black ball (heads) and one white ball (tails).", out.width = '20%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/coinurn.png")
```

A single coin toss can be modelled by an urn with two balls. When a ball is drawn randomly from the urn, the probability to get the black ball (heads) is $P(X=H) = 0.5$.

If we want to simulate tossing 20 coins (or one coin 220 times) we can use the same urn model, if the ball is replaced after each draw.

In R we can simulate random draws from an urn model using the function `sample`.

```{r coin, echo=TRUE}
# A single coin toss
sample(c("H", "T"), size=1)
# Another coin toss
sample(c("H", "T"), size=1)
```

Every time you run the sample a new coin toss is simulated. 

The argument `size` tells the function how many balls we want to draw from the urn. To draw 20 balls from the urn, set `size=20`, remember to replace the ball after each draw!

```{r coins, echo=TRUE}
# 20 independent coin tosses
(coins <- sample(c("H", "T"), size=20, replace=TRUE))
```

How many heads did we get in the 20 random draws?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# How many heads?
sum(coins == "H")
```

We can repeat this experiment (toss 20 coins and count the number of heads) several times to eastimate the distribution of number of heads in 20 coin tosses.

To do the same thing several times we use the function `replicate`.

```{r Nheads, echo=TRUE}
Nheads <- replicate(1000, {
  coins <- sample(c("H", "T"), size=20, replace=TRUE)
  sum(coins == "H")
})
```

Plot distribution of the number of heads in a histogram.

```{r histNheads, echo=TRUE}
hist(Nheads, breaks=0:20)
```

Now, let's get back to the question; when tossing 20 coins, what is the probability of at least 15 heads?

$P(X \geq 15)$

Count how many times out of our 1000 exeriments the number is 15 or greater

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(Nheads >= 15)
```

From this we conclude that

$P(X \geq 15) =$ `r sum(Nheads>=15)/length(Nheads)`


```{exercise, "Cointoss", echo=TRUE}
In a single coin toss the probabity of heads is 0.5.

In 20 coin tosses,   

  a) what is the probability of exactly 15 heads?
  b) what is the probability of less than 7 heads?
  c) What is the most probable number of heads?
  d) what is the probability of 5 tails or less?
  e) what is the probability of 2 heads or less?
```

```{exercise, "Dice", echo=TRUE}
When rolling 10 six sided dice, what is the probability to get at least 5 sixes?
```

```{exercise, "Pollen", echo=TRUE}
30% of a large populationis allergic to pollen. If you randomly select 12 people to participate in your study, what is the probability than none of them will be allergic to pollen?
```

## Parametric discrete distributions

### Bernoulli trial

A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment with two outcomes; success and failure. The probability of success, $P(success) = p$, is constant. The probability of failure is $P(failure) = 1-p$.

When coding it is convenient to code success as 1 and failure as 0.

The outcome of a Bernoulli trial is a discrete random variable, $X$.

```{r}
kable(matrix(c('x','0','1','p(x)','1-p','p'), byrow=TRUE, ncol=3)) %>% kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

### Binomial distribution

Also the number of successes in a series of independent and identical Bernoulli trials is a discrete random variable.

$Y = \sum_{i=0}^n X_i$
  
The probability mass function of $Y$ is called the binomial distribution.

### Hypergeometric distribution

### Poisson distribution
