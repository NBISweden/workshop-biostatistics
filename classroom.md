#### Where should you be and when (rule of thumb)


**live stream**

* Zoom main room to listen and talk
* Zulip D1 on Monday, D2 on Tuesday etc. to discuss in writing

**group sessions**

* Zoom group rooms
* check your group allocation on Zulip -> Announcements -> Groups

**exercises**
_choose to do whatever works best for you (anything goes)_

  - Main room on Zoom to stay connected
  - Quiet room on Zoom to stay connected but work in peace
  - Group room: stay with your group
  - Join another group if your group members have disappeared and you do not like to be alone
  - Extra rooms (1-5) if you've found someone you want to discuss with
  - Offline

**stuck with exercises? Choose:**

* Main room: to ask questions (be brave, we all benefit from hearing your question)
* Write on Zulip under D1, D2 etc. (be brave)
* You are not having a brave day: ask anyone on the teaching team directly on Zulip
Psss...Eva, Payam and Bengt are statistical geeks and Mun-Gwuan, Nima and Lucile are super helpful


_Note: you should be able to move between break out room. Try updating your Zomm if this is not the case._

#### Cameras and photos
* please have your cameras on during online session and group sessions
* please mute yourselves during lectures when not talking
* please update your profiles on Zulip with a photo
* it is OK to disconnect during exercises
