- 11th - 15th, May, 2020
- SciLifeLab, Uppsala University, BMC, Husargatan 3, E10:1308

National course open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within all Swedish universities.  The course is geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods. It would also suit those already applying biostatistical methods but have never got a chance to reflect on and truly grasp the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value.

##### <img border="0" src="icons/education.svg" width="40" height="40"> Education
In this course we focus on an active learning approach. The course participants are expected to do some pre-course reading and exercises, corresponding up to 40h studying. The education consists of teaching blocks alternating between mini-lectures, group discussions, live coding sessions etc. A special focus is put on understanding basic concepts by solving problems with pen and paper.
