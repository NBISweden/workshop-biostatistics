### About


**Biostatistics Essentials: a blackboard approach**

*National course open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within all Swedish universities.  The course is geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical methods. It would also suit those already applying biostatistical methods but have never got a chance to reflect on and truly grasp the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value!*

Responsible teachers:  [Olga Dethlefsen][olga] <<olga.dethlefsen@nbis.se>>, [Eva Freyhult][eva] <<eva.freyhult@nbis.se>>

##### Course content
- Basic statistical theory and concepts incl. stochastic variables, density and distribution functions, central limit theorem, confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- Resampling
- Linear and logistic regression methods
- Model selection and regularization
- Unsupervised learning, incl. clustering and dimension reduction methods

<br/><br/>

##### Education
In this course we focus on active learning approach. The course participants are expected to do some pre-course reading and exercises, corresponding up to 16h studying. The education consists of teaching blocks alternating between mini-lectures, group discussions, live coding sessions etc. A special focus is put on understanding basic concepts by solving problems with pen and paper. We believe in less-is-more principle, so be ready to say no to digital exhaustion to truly learn something with our modern “blackboard approach”.
