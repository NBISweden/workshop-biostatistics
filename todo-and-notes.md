title:  'To Do'
---


## Content
- overall: go through materials with fresh eyes, make sure we have all solutions
- improve? daily questions? Leave some mistakes on purpose to get the discussion going?
- Olga: add correct Gini index equation and example to decision tree
- add binomial to pre-course
- move more of the probability to the course?
- add some basic R tutorial (see what we are covering and make exercises for that)
- add finding the best number of clusters in k-means
- suggestion from a student: start each session with why we are learning a thing (biological example) and then go into how. 

## Content adjustments
- more time to go through each individual thing
- free up some time
- move probability to pre-course
- write course specific R tutorial
- ANOVA, F-test?
- decision trees - expand to random forest
- remove ANN?
- add PLS
- add derivation of least squares as supplementary to linear models
- add multi-categorical logistic regression example (extra reading)
- add mixed effect models example (extra reading)
- add at the end of chapters: similar methods, methods extensions, i.e. where to go next
- same dataset throughout the week? make up one with toxicity levels, gene expression response, 2 groups, count data of number of mutations
- pipeline of analysis: data cleaning, data exploration and then biostatistics and machine learning  
- p-value of the lm model

## Select students a bit better
- it is introductory course

## Running things on Zoom
- room camera for exercises
- spotlight on host for live streaming
- find a good annotation tool
- activate students: get them to answer and ask questions
